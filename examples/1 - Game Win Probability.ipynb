    "## Game Win Probability vs. Point Win Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between **point-winning probability** and **game-winning probability** in tennis is inherently non-linear. Even a modest advantage at the point level is **amplified over the course of a game** by the structure of the scoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a server who wins **60% of points on serve** will win approximately **74% of their service games**. This amplification effect is a fundamental feature of tennis scoring and explains why small differences in point-level performance can translate into large differences in match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `probabilityServerWinsGame` function computes the probability that the server wins a game for any given starting score, assuming a fixed probability of winning an individual point on serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Function Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the calculation is based on **enumerating possible score progressions** from the current game score to the end of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate all possible score paths** starting from the given initial score and ending with the server winning the game.\n",
    "2. **Compute the probability of each path**, based on the probability \\( p \\) that the server wins a single point.\n",
    "3. **Sum the probabilities** of all winning paths to obtain the overall game-winning probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we do **not explicitly generate all possible paths**. Under standard advantage scoring, the number of possible paths is infinite because the game can return to *deuce* arbitrarily many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this, path generation stops once the score reaches **deuce**. From deuce onward, the probability that the server eventually wins the game is computed using a **closed-form expression** derived from the geometric series of repeated deuce outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{p^2}{1 - 2p(1 - p)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( p \\) is the probability that the server wins a point.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The **No-Ad rule** (used in doubles and in junior tournaments) eliminates the advantage phase at deuce. Instead, at deuce (40–40), the **next point decides the game**, with the receiver choosing which side to receive.\n",

    "\n",
