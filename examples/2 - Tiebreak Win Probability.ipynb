    "## Tiebreak Win Probability vs. Serve Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a regular service game—where only the server’s point-winning probability matters—a **tiebreak** depends on **both players’ serve probabilities**, because the serve alternates throughout the tiebreak according to a fixed pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `probabilityP1WinsTiebreak` function computes the probability that **Player 1** wins a tiebreak, given:\n",
    "- **p1**: the probability Player 1 wins a point when serving\n",
    "- **p2**: the probability Player 2 wins a point when serving\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Function Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the calculation follows the same general principle as for games:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enumerate all possible tiebreak score paths** consistent with the alternating service order.\n",
    "2. **Compute the probability of each path**, using **p1** for points served by Player 1 and **p2** for points served by Player 2.\n",
    "3. **Sum the probabilities** of all paths in which Player 1 wins the tiebreak (first to 7 points, leading by at least 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a tiebreak can continue indefinitely once it reaches 6–6, there are infinitely many possible ways it can unfold. To handle this, we explicitly compute all score paths up to the first 6–6 tie, and then use a mathematical shortcut to account for everything that can happen after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot shows a **family of curves**, each corresponding to a fixed value of **p2**, while **p1** varies along the horizontal axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When **p1 = p2**, the tiebreak is symmetric and Player 1’s probability of winning is approximately **50%**.\n",
    "- As the serve probabilities diverge, the curves show how even small differences in serve effectiveness can produce meaningful advantages over the course of a tiebreak."
