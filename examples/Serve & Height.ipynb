    "# Serve & Height\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes the relationship between player height and serve effectiveness in professional tennis. Using historical match data, we investigate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does player height affect ace percentage?\n",
    "- Does height influence 1st and 2nd serve win percentages?\n",
    "- Do left-handed players have a serve advantage after controlling for height?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis requires `tennis_db.sqlite` in the `examples/` folder. If not already present, download it from the [Kaggle Tennis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis).\n",
